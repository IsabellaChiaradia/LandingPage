            <p>Jennifer Walters is a world-class New York City attorney in which her talents match that those of the best defense attorneys in New York, although she often takes on cases that appeal more to her sense of justice rather than her pocketbook.
            A close friend of the Fantastic Four, She-Hulk has stood in for Ben Grimm as the team's fourth member, fought alongside the Avengers, the Fearless Defenders, A-Force and several other groups. Unlike the Hulk, Jennifer has nearly always retained her intelligence, ingenuity, and cleverness while in her She-Hulk form and, also unlike her cousin, tends to embrace her alter ego. She-Hulk is extraordinarily strong and tough, able to leap great heights, and hold her own in a physical fight against some of the most formidable powerhouses on Earth. Notably, unlike Bruce Banner and others who have become Hulk-like creatures thanks to Gamma exposure, she retains her intelligence in She-Hulk form.</p>
